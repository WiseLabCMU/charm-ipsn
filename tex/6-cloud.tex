\section{Charm in the Cloud}
\label{sec:cloud}

At the cloud, Charm seeks to coherently combine received signals from multiple
gateways to recover weak received signals. At a high level, Charm collates I/Q
samples from multiple gateways and estimates their packet start time and
wireless channel. It then uses standard coherent SIMO combining (see
Sec.~\ref{sec:simo}) of the same weak transmission across multiple gateways to
ensure that the data can be accurately recovered. Charm repeats this
cloud-based PHY-layer processing at city scale across clients and gateways.

The rest of this section describes the key challenges and opportunities in
making the above design scalable and practical. First, we describe Charm's
approach to ensure accurate time-synchronization between gateways -- showing
how even an offset of one or two samples can be severely detrimental to
coherent combining. Second, we present our solution to dynamically infer
signals from which gateways need to be combined over time to best recover a
weak signal. Finally, we present opportunities to improve bandwidth and system
performance at the cloud by avoiding wasted transmissions of I/Q data to the
cloud as well as wasted computation.

\subsection{Time Synchronization at the Cloud}
Charm relies on the accurate timing of received weak signals at the gateways
for two important reasons: First, any offset in timing between signals
corresponding to the same packet across  gateways will prevent the signals
from coherently combining. Second, the precise start time of packets across
gateways is valuable information to identify the packet, allowing Charm to
infer which received signals across gateways correspond to the same packet.

A naive approach to synchronize base stations would be to synchronize them
through highly accurate clocks (GPS-synced) or through time-synchronization
protocols in software over the backbone network (e.g. NTP). In practice, for
indoor gateways (e.g. set top boxes) connected to an Ethernet backhaul, these
can provide time synchronization of up to a few milliseconds. In practical
terms, this means that the received signals at the gateways can be time
synchronized to within a small number of time samples.

Unfortunately, even a small offset in the timing between two gateways can
severely deteriorate coherent combining. Fig.~\ref{fig:toffset} depicts a
simple example of the phase difference between two gateways whose signals are
offset by zero and one sample respectively. We note that even an offset of one
frequency bin causes a significant time-varying error in phase between the
gateways. As a result, summing up these signals would cause some symbols
in-phase to reinforce, while others that are out-of-phase cancel each other.

\noindent {\bf Phase-Based Time-Sync Below the Noise: } Charm overcomes this
challenge by recognizing that small time-errors between two gateways results
in a phase difference over time that is predictable. As shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:toffset}, this phase difference is a linear function of time,
given by $2\pi f(t) \delta t$, where $f(t)$ is the instantaneous frequency of
the chirp (linear in time) and $\delta t$ is the required timing offset. In
principle, one can therefore estimate the slope in phase over time to recover
the timing offset. In practice however, doing so is challenging, particularly
when each received signal at each gateway is completely buried below the
noise. The phase of such signals at any such gateway simply appears to be
random -- making any form of linear regression of the slope highly
error-prone.

Charm overcomes this challenge using two key properties: First, owing to
coarse time synchronization of the gateways (via NTP), any residual timing
error between them is limited to a few samples. This allows Charm to
iteratively optimize over a small number of time-shifts to infer the offset
that leads to the best fit. Second, Charm's can extract timing offsets both
from the preamble and the data symbols. To see how, notice that our approach
only considers the {\it difference} in phase between the same packet heard at
two different gateways. Given that, in the absence of timing offsets, both
gateways perceive the same underlying message bits over time, the resulting
phase difference would be independent of the transmitted data bits -- whether
they belong to the preamble or data.

Charm's approach therefore considers a the range of possible small offsets
between any two received signal sequences. For each candidate offset, it
computes the phase difference between the signals as a function of time. It
then identifies the true offset between the gateways as the one whose phase
difference varies minimally across the entire packet. Given that our approach
averages measurements through the entire packet (both preamble and data), it
remains highly resilient to noise.\vspace*{0.1in}


\noindent {\bf Maintaining Synchronization across Packets: } Finally, Charm
can learn the time-offsets between gateways, particularly in busy urban
deployments, by using information from past packets. Recall that Charm's
coherent is only affected by timing errors between pairs of gateways -- not
the gateway and any particular client. While these errors may change over
time, over small intervals (e.g. hundreds of milliseconds), they are unlikely
to change. As a result, one can use the measured time offset from a previous
packet to infer the offset at the next packet that follows soon after. This
allows us to maintain a history of the time-offsets, smoothed by algorithms
such as Kalman filtering with outlier rejection, that helps us better predict
time offsets between gateways even when signals from certain clients are too
weak to measure these reliably.

\subsection{Joint Decoding at the Cloud}
\label{sec:joint-decoding-cloud}
This section answers an important question: How does Charm decide which weak
signals received from a set of gateways need to be combined coherently? In
other words, Charm must identify which signals at the gateway correspond to
the same packet from the same transmitter. It must do so even in the presence
of overlapping transmissions from multiple clients at geographically different
locations.

\noindent {\bf Who should we combine?: } Charm addresses this challenge by
using the timing information of packets to infer transmissions that correspond
to the same user. It further uses the perceived signal-to-noise ratios and
geographic location of the gateways and measures the likelihood that far-away
gateways can listen to transmissions from the users at the observed
signal-to-noise ratios. It then calculates a feature vector for each received
signal that contains two tuple: (1) The time instance at which the packet was
received; and (2) The geographic location of the gateway. We apply the OPTICS
clustering algorithm~\cite{ankerst1999optics} to then cluster received signals
from multiple clients at any time instance.

Past-clustering, we combine received signals from a subset of clients in each
cluster. Specifically, we only choose to combine signals with a sufficiently
high signal-to-noise ratio. This is because transmissions that are highly
noisy tend to add little additional value yet cost uplink bandwidth.

An important consequence of our clustering approach based on geographic
location of the gateway is that it facilitates spatial re-use. Specifically,
it is quite possible that weak transmissions from two different neighborhoods
occur at the same time but are heard at distinct subsets of gateways. Charm
allows us to decode these transmissions simultaneously without mixing up their
signals. Indeed, gateways that are geographically in-between and hear
interfering signals from both clients can be simply weeded out from clustering
due to their poor signal-to-noise ratio.

\noindent {\bf Joint Decoding Algorithm: } Algorithm~\ref{alg:algorithm-label}
below describes Charm's joint-decoding algorithm end-to-end. At a high level,
our approach retrieves the wireless channels of the signals to be combined at
any instance, their timing offsets and frequency offsets computed as described
in the above sections. We, then eliminate any phase errors owing to time and
frequency offsets in the received signals. We then coherently sum up the
resulting signals multiplied by the conjugate channels as described in
Sec.~\ref{sec:background}.

\subsection{Opportunistic Fetching of Information}
Our design thus far assumes Charm gateways relay raw I/Q received signals to
the cloud, only if their signals are too weak to be decoded, yet can be
detected. However, this approach can be ineffective for two reasons: (1) On
the one hand, the cloud may have already received the decoded data bits from
another gateway, meaning that Charm simply wasted uplink bandwidth
unnecessarily; (2) On the other hand, some received signals may be
significantly below the noise floor even to be detected, yet be valuable
enough to be relayed to the cloud to be jointly decoded with other such weak
receptions.

\noindent {\bf Two-Phase Data Fetch: } Charm overcomes these challenge through
a pull based approach where gateways relay raw I/Q samples to the cloud, only
when explicitly asked for by the cloud. Each gateway keeps a circular buffer
of I/Q streams as well as any recent snapshots containing a potential packet.
For each potential reception, a gateway first reports its signature (center
frequency and spreading factor), the time of the reception packet, the
perceived wireless channel and signal-to-noise ratio. Charm then performs
clustering as described above and requests the raw I/Q samples {\it only }
from clients whose signals were chosen to be combined. Given that latency to
the cloud are of the order of few milliseconds, smaller than a typical LoRaWAN
packet size (tens, often hundreds of milliseconds), our system can perform
decoding virtually in real-time at LPWAN timescales, despite incurring
multiple round-trip times in fetching information.

\noindent {\bf Opportunistic Data Buffering: } In some instances, Charm's
clustering algorithm may fail to have enough signals to successfully combine
and decode a packet using the gateways that detected the packet alone.
However, Charm may be able to opportunistically fetch information from other
gateways in the same geographical region of the cluster and tuned to the same
frequency who may have received the same signal, yet at a signal-to-noise
ratio too weak to detect locally. Charm therefore requires all gateways to
store past signals for up to 1.6 seconds (maximum LoRaWAN packet length) in
the past in a 5 MB circular buffer. This allows Charm to query and fetch
signals from gateways, even in scenarios where only one gateway in the entire
network was able to locally detect a signal from a given transmitting client.
