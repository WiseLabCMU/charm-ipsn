\begin{abstract}


Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LP-WANs) are an emerging wireless platform which
can support battery-powered devices lasting 10-years while communicating at
low data-rates to gateways several miles away. Despite the expected
high-density of LP-WAN gateways in future cities, not all devices will
experience the promised 10-year battery life, particularly in urban spaces. A
large number of devices deep inside buildings or in remote
neighborhoods will suffer severe battery-drain due to extended transmissions
at the slowest data rate to reach even the closest gateway.

This paper presents Charm, a system that enhances both battery life and
coverage of LP-WAN clients in large urban deployments. Charm allows multiple
LoRaWAN gateways to pool their received signals in the cloud, coherently
combining them to detect even the weakest signal that is not decodable at any
individual gateway. Charm achieves this through a novel hardware and software
design at the gateway that carefully detects which chunks of the received
signal need to be sent to the cloud, thereby saving uplink bandwidth. We
demonstrate how our solution scales to decoding weak transmissions at
city-scale, by identifying the set of gateways whose signals need to be
coherently combined over time. In evaluations over a test network and from
simulations using traces from a large LoRaWAN deployment in Pittsburgh, Charm
demonstrates a significant gain of up to 3$\times$ in range and 4$\times$ in client
battery-life.
