\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}

{\color{blue} Points to cover:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Local packet detection: Error CDF vs SNR
    \item Diversity gain: Usable spreading factors vs distance/SNR
    \item Impact on client power: Device power trace, Battery life vs distance
    \item Increased capacity due to sensitivity gain (in simulation)
\end{itemize}

We implemented our system using 8 <name of the board> boards as base stations
distributed across a university campus.  We used a Semtech SX1276 LoRaWAN
transmitter as the client device. We use Charm as the software platform at the
backend to support backhaul. We evaluate our system both through
proof-of-concept experiments and large-scale trace-driven simulations. We
perform our experiments in various environments(both indoors and outdoors) to
ensure the viability of the approach in different situations.
