{\color{blue} Points to cover:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The goal: decode weak transmission by collating information from multiple base-stations
    \item Flow diagram (picture with cloudy and edgy stuff)
    \item The strawman comparison: stream everything
    \item Strawman limitations
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Weak signals and limited bandwidth (problems at gateways (could use joint decoding of preambles but cant afford to stream everything))
            \item Scaling issues (problems at the cloud)
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}

The goal of Charm is to decode weak transmission, those that could not be
decoded by any individual gateway, by collating receptions from multiple
gateways.


Points:

Clients remain unmodified

Gateways are slightly modified, though the modification could be easily integrated into the existing gateways

The cloud server does a lot of the smart stuff for selecting which chunks to decode and actually decodes them
