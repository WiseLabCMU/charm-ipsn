\label{sec:arch}

{\color{blue} Points to cover:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The goal: decode weak transmission by collating information from multiple base-stations
    \item Flow diagram (picture with cloudy and edgy stuff)
    \item The strawman comparison: stream everything
    \item Strawman limitations
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Weak signals and limited bandwidth (problems at gateways (could use joint decoding of preambles but cant afford to stream everything))
            \item Scaling issues (problems at the cloud)
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
