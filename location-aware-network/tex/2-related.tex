\noindent \textbf{Low-Power Wide-Area Networks: } Recent years have seen much interest in Low-Power wide area networks (LP-WANs), including the development of new hardware and standards. Private enterprises such as Semtech~\cite{Sornin2015, LoRaWanAlliance2015} and SigFox~\cite{sanchez2016state} have developed LP-WAN chips that use extremely narrow bands of unlicensed spectrum. In contrast, cellular standardization bodies have developed two standards for LP-WAN communication for cellular base stations to communicate with low-power IoT devices over licensed spectrum: LTE-M~\cite{GSMAssociation2016} and NB-IOT~\cite{Ratasuk2016}. Unlike LoRa and SigFox, these technologies require devices to periodically wake up to synchronize with the network -- a burden on battery life.

Several recent measurement studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance and range of LP-WAN networks~\cite{petric2016measurements, 7499263, toldov2016performance} and perform theoretical capacity analysis~\cite{mikhaylov2016analysis}. Early pilot deployment efforts are also underway with SigFox deploying their hardware to connect security alarms to the cloud in Spain~\cite{sanchez2016state}, smart blood refrigerators in the Democratic Republic of the Congo~\cite{ramachandranmupnp} and smart city applications \cite{centenaro2015long}. These efforts motivate the challenge of scalability of LP-WANs, particularly in dense urban scenarios. While recent trends such as the opening up of the TV whitespaces~\cite{FCC_Whitespaces} has resulted in increased spectrum, there remains the need to study the scaling limits and spectrum management strategies for city-scale LP-WANs. Our paper addresses this lacuna in literature by exploring LP-WAN spectrum and network management over unlicensed spectrum including the TV whitespaces. \\\vspace*{-0.1in}
