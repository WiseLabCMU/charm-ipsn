\noindent \textbf{Low-Power Wide-Area Networks: } {\color{blue} (get rid of network coverage and scalability stuff)} Recent years have seen much
interest in Low-Power wide area networks (LP-WANs), including the development
of new hardware and standards. Private enterprises such as
Semtech~\cite{Sornin2015, LoRaWanAlliance2015} and
SigFox~\cite{sanchez2016state} have developed LP-WAN chips that use extremely
narrow bands of unlicensed spectrum. In contrast, cellular standardization
bodies have developed two standards for LP-WAN communication for cellular base
stations to communicate with low-power IoT devices over licensed spectrum:
LTE-M~\cite{GSMAssociation2016} and NB-IOT~\cite{Ratasuk2016}. Unlike LoRa and
SigFox, these technologies require devices to periodically wake up to
synchronize with the network -- a burden on battery life.

Several recent measurement studies have been conducted to evaluate the
performance and range of LP-WAN networks~\cite{petric2016measurements,
7499263, toldov2016performance} and perform theoretical capacity
analysis~\cite{mikhaylov2016analysis}. Early pilot deployment efforts are also
underway with SigFox deploying their hardware to connect security alarms to
the cloud in Spain~\cite{sanchez2016state}, smart blood refrigerators in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo~\cite{ramachandranmupnp} and smart city
applications \cite{centenaro2015long}. These efforts motivate the challenge of
scalability of LP-WANs, particularly in dense urban scenarios. While recent
trends such as the opening up of the TV whitespaces~\cite{FCC_Whitespaces} has
resulted in increased spectrum, there remains the need to study the scaling
limits and spectrum management strategies for city-scale LP-WANs. Our paper
addresses this lacuna in literature by exploring LP-WAN spectrum and network
management over unlicensed spectrum including the TV whitespaces.
