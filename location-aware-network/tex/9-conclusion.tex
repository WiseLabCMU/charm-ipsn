% This paper presents a novel location-aware network management system for LoRa-class LP-WANs operating in unlicensed and whitespace frequencies. It presents an RF-based localization system that 
% stitches together information across frequencies to improve positioning accuracy of LoRa clients, even without access to their channel state information. We build on the localization framework to build a resource allocation system for LP-WAN that efficiently allocates wireless resources subject to FCC's regulatory constraints.  Our network-management system  is designed to be location-aware, exploiting live measurements to identify and respond to interference and help network managers plan changes to deployment. Our system was implemented and deployed in a large university campus and results from proof-of-concept experiments and large-scale trace-driven simulations are presented. In the future, we aim to expand our deployment to incorporate transmissions on the white spaces and are currently engaged in efforts to procure the relevant licenses. We also intend to integrate smart sensor devices currently deployed on-campus with LoRaWAN radios to evaluate our network management platform live and at-scale.
