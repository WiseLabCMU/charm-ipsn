\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


% Long distance high-quality communication systems are required to provide a large number of modern IoT services across sectors. 
Low Power Wide Area Networks (LP-WANs) are increasingly seen as an attractive communication platform for city-scale Internet-of-Things (IoT) deployments.
They offer the ability to wirelessly connect energy-constrained devices to gateways over distances of many kilometers.
LP-WANs also have power and cost advantages over alternatives like cellular networks, particularly in deploy-once, low-maintenance and low throughput sensing applications

While far from pervasive, the capabilities of LP-WANs like LoRaWAN~\cite{Sornin2015, LoRaWanAlliance2015}, SigFox~\cite{centenaro2016} and Ingenu's RPMA~\cite{Ingenu2015} have attracted investment and have spawned early deployments. 
These technologies operate on unlicensed spectrum, allowing businesses and consumers alike to deploy their own base stations.
With the recent announcement by Comcast {\color{red}~\cite{}} to integrate LP-WAN radios into future set-top boxes in the U.S., LP-WANs are likely to scale rapidly.
Indeed, major cities in the U.S. are likely to see fast-paced LP-WAN coverage, given that each LP-WAN base station promises a range of up to ten kilometers~\cite{LoRaWanAlliance2015}. 


%% Still have range and power issues
%% TODO: elaborate exactly what these issues are
Yet, the maximum range of LP-WAN base stations of 10 kilometers comes at a cost -- battery-drain. 
Specifically, the further an LP-WAN device is from a base station, the more power it is likely to expend to transmit the same amount of information{\color{red}~\cite{}}. 
{\color{blue} (Sudden jump from LP-WAN to LoRaWAN... What is the knob that enables jumping from 1 year to 10 years?)}
In practical terms for instance, this reduces the battery life of a LoRaWAN device from 10-years when in close proximity of the base station to just 1 year at maximum range{\color{red}~\cite{}}.
{\color{blue} (The suburban argument is not convincing (and may not even be true). Focus on battery and more uniform coverage.)} Given that LP-WANs base station deployments will be at their densest in cities, suburban areas are likely to bear the brunt of poor performance and reduced battery life.
{\color{blue} (Add some actual power numbers.)}
More fundamentally, LP-WANs unlike cellular deployments are unlicensed and unplanned, meaning that the outermost suburban neighborhoods may simply be beyond the range of LP-WAN coverage, while cities remain over-provisioned. 


This paper presents Charm, a system that enhances the battery-life and coverage of LoRaWAN clients in large urban deployments.
Charm exploits the observation that while signals from a distant and hard to reach clients may attenuate significantly, they are still likely to be received by multiple base stations. 
Charm develop a collaborative joint-decoding system that coherently combines weak signals heard across multiple city base stations to decode the underlying information. 
As a result, it both expands the decoding range of the LP-WAN network and improves battery-life for nodes already in range. 
Charm is implemented in a first-of-its-kind low-power wide-area pilot deployment of joint decoding serving a large neighborhood of a major U.S. city and demonstrates increased coverage and battery-life for nodes in surrounding neighborhoods. 

% Intro to LoRa and LoRaWAN that introduces all the necessary terminology
LoRa is an emerging LP-WAN technology from Semtech that uses chirp spread-spectrum that trades off low bit rate for long range. 
An important parameter is the spreading factor: different spreading factors can be independently received and end up affecting the transmission time, bit rate and sensitivity of the transmission. 
LoRaWAN defines the higher levels of the networking stack that enable device-centric unidirectional or bi-directional communication. 
LoRaWAN gateways are typically inexpensive, simple forwarders that send all decoded packets to a server in the cloud over a regular internet connection, the cloud-server then decides which gateways should respond. 
LoRaWAN also allows and encourages clients to deploy their own unplanned gateways (which we call \textit{user-deployed gateway} or \textit{UGW}) to expand the coverage of the network.

\end{figure}

{\color{blue} (Intuitively, explain how does Charm's approach actually leads to client power savings)}
Charm allows users who are in range to transmit at faster data rates that would not have been decodable using a single gateway receiver. 
This allows for more air time for weaker transmissions from further away clients. 

% Why is it hard?
The main challenges in designing a city-scale joint-decoding system stem from three main causes: 1. very weak receptions, 2. limited bandwidth from the gateway to the cloud server and 3. challenges in scaling at the cloud.

\textit{Challenges at the Gateway:} Gateways receive transmissions from distant clients which are far below the noise floor. These transmissions are not only difficult to detect but also cannot be decoded independently. {\color{blue} (Add actual numbers?)}
Using an approach similar to {\color{red}~\cite{} (Cloud RAN?)} would require continuously streaming all the raw received signals to a cloud-based decoder for both detection and decoding.
Such an approach places a heavy cost on the internet bandwidth between the gateway and the cloud, which is particularly infeasible for UGWs.
% This means the devices will have to continuously stream all their received raw signal data through a backbone for packet detection and decoding the data. 
% This imposes a huge cost on the bandwidth of the backbone and also is also infeasible at low latency.
% To make matters worse, the received signals are challenging to synchronize, given the timing and frequency offsets between the base stations themselves. 

Although LoRaWAN gateways are very capable, they do not provide the raw baseband quadrature signals which are required for joint decoding. 
We developed a low-cost auxiliary platform, called RFTAP that uses a similar radio frontend combined with a FPGA and Raspberry Pi for local signal processing. 
This auxiliary hardware behaves like a software-defined radio in the 900 MHz ISM band, generating processed quadrature streams and computing local parameters (like spreading factor and center frequency which are necessary inputs for the cloud-decoding algorithm).

Our solution to the bandwidth limitation problem leverages the structure of LoRaWAN LP-WAN packets. 
We develop a solution that detects LoRaWAN packets even if they are 37~dB below the noise floor and therefore remain completely non-decodable. 
Our solution exploits the presence of a large number of repeated preambles in LoRaWAN (up to 16 in the standard). 
Specifically, we correlate the received sequence with long-sequences of LoRaWAN chirps to detect the locations of packets. 
We repeat this process across gateways and quickly alert neighboring base stations, should a preamble be detected. 
The base station also does this for correctly decoded packets -- eliminating the need for base stations to upload weak signals for packets already decoded.  
Owing to the lenient latency constraints for acknowledgement of a packet in LoRaWAN (one to two seconds), our approach readily scales to a large-scale network. 
In effect, our approach therefore only streams to the cloud signals that correspond to valid packets. 

\textit{Scalability at the Cloud:} {\color{blue} (This section still needs lots of work)}
Another challenge Charm must deal with given its expanded coverage, is the problem of processing a large number of streams to be combined and decoded. 

{\color{blue} Points to cover:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How to avoid wasted computations through our distributed algorithm (short-circuiting, selectively combining streams based on location, frequency and time)
    \item How is this scalable? i.e. why can we support more nodes in the network now? (transmit time decreases)
    \item What is the software/cloud infrastructure required to support these operations?
\end{itemize}
}
% Indeed, one would imagine that given that Charm serves a much larger coverage area, it scales poorly owing to collisions between users already in the network and users who newly gain coverage. 
% Counter-intuitively, we observe that in practice this is not the case. 

% We show how Charm scales despite collisions from transmissions in different geographical neighborhoods by exploiting spatial reuse -- the fact that some base stations are closer to one neighborhood and farther than the other. {\color{blue} Mention things like short-circuiting. }

%Coherent combination of packets requires inversion of individual channel effects on each of the data stream. However, across a packet the effects of the channel can be estimated by extrapolation of the channel effects at the preamble. This means we can estimate the channel at the preamble(which we can compare with a standard preamble to get the channel) and expect it to follow the same hardware offset drift pattern across the rest of the packet. Using this channel measurement we can invert the effect of channel and get all the signals in phase which we can then constructively combine to receive the packet at a much higher SNR.

{\color{blue} (Add some introduction about the nature of experiments.)} In our evaluations, we demonstrate the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We improve the range at SF 7 by XXX m, SF 10 by YYY m , and SF 12 by ZZZ m.
    \item With 8 base stations, we can add X m$^2$ more area to our coverage area.
    \item We can achieve gains of J dBW,K dBW and LdBW for the signal using 3, 6 and 8 base stations, respectively.
    \item We require overheads of K MBps and provide a latency of T ms for detection and decoding of a packet with 8 base stations. 
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Contributions:} In this paper we present the following novel contributions.
\begin{itemize}
    \item A technique that leverages the geographical diversity of unplanned user-deployed gateways to enable joint decoding of weak transmissions. This improves the quality-of-service for all users and increases the coverage area.
    \item A hardware platform and the underlying algorithms for processing quadrature streams and detection of LoRa preambles in weak transmissions, both done locally. To reduce gateway internet bandwidth requirements, we also introduce a scheme that selectively forwards a subset of probable candidates to a cloud-based joint decoder.
    \item A software architecture that builds on top of LoRaWAN to enable joint-decoding of transmissions in a scaleable manner.
\end{itemize}
