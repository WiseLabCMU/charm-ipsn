\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}


% Long distance high-quality communication systems are required to provide a large number of modern IoT services across sectors. 
Low Power Wide Area Networks (LP-WANs) are increasingly seen as an attractive
communication platform for city-scale Internet-of-Things (IoT) deployments.
They offer the ability to wirelessly connect energy-constrained devices to
gateways over distances of many kilometers. LP-WANs also have power and cost
advantages over alternatives like cellular networks, particularly in
deploy-once, low-maintenance and low throughput sensing applications

While far from pervasive, the capabilities of LP-WANs like
LoRaWAN~\cite{Sornin2015, LoRaWanAlliance2015}, SigFox~\cite{centenaro2016}
and Ingenu's RPMA~\cite{Ingenu2015} have attracted investment and have spawned
early deployments. These technologies operate on unlicensed spectrum, allowing
businesses and consumers alike to deploy their own base stations. With the
recent announcement by Comcast {\color{red}~\cite{}} to integrate LP-WAN
radios into future set-top boxes in the U.S., LP-WANs are likely to scale
rapidly. Indeed, major cities in the U.S. are likely to see fast-paced LP-WAN
coverage, given that each LP-WAN base station promises a range of up to ten
kilometers~\cite{LoRaWanAlliance2015}.


%% Still have range and power issues
%% TODO: elaborate exactly what these issues are
Yet, the maximum range of LP-WAN base stations of 10 kilometers comes at a
cost -- battery-drain. Specifically, the further an LP-WAN device is from a
base station, the more power it is likely to expend to transmit the same
amount of information{\color{red}~\cite{}}. {\color{blue} (Sudden jump from
LP-WAN to LoRaWAN... What is the knob that enables jumping from 1 year to 10
years?)} In practical terms for instance, this reduces the battery life of a
LoRaWAN device from 10-years when in close proximity of the base station to
just 1 year at maximum range{\color{red}~\cite{}}. {\color{blue} (The suburban
argument is not convincing (and may not even be true). Focus on battery and
more uniform coverage.)} Given that LP-WANs base station deployments will be
at their densest in cities, suburban areas are likely to bear the brunt of
poor performance and reduced battery life. {\color{blue} (Add some actual
power numbers.)} More fundamentally, LP-WANs unlike cellular deployments are
unlicensed and unplanned, meaning that the outermost suburban neighborhoods
may simply be beyond the range of LP-WAN coverage, while cities remain
over-provisioned.


This paper presents Charm, a system that enhances the battery-life and
coverage of LoRaWAN clients in large urban deployments. Charm exploits the
observation that while signals from a distant and hard to reach clients may
attenuate significantly, they are still likely to be received by multiple base
stations. Charm develop a collaborative joint-decoding system that coherently
combines weak signals heard across multiple city base stations to decode the
underlying information. As a result, it both expands the decoding range of the
LP-WAN network and improves battery-life for nodes already in range. Charm is
implemented in a first-of-its-kind low-power wide-area pilot deployment of
joint decoding serving a large neighborhood of a major U.S. city and
demonstrates increased coverage and battery-life for nodes in surrounding
neighborhoods.

% Intro to LoRa and LoRaWAN that introduces all the necessary terminology
LoRa is an emerging LP-WAN technology from Semtech that uses chirp
spread-spectrum that trades off low bit rate for long range. An important
parameter is the spreading factor: different spreading factors can be
independently received and end up affecting the transmission time, bit rate
and sensitivity of the transmission. LoRaWAN defines the higher levels of the
networking stack that enable device-centric unidirectional or bi-directional
communication. LoRaWAN gateways are typically inexpensive, simple forwarders
that send all decoded packets to a server in the cloud over a regular internet
connection, the cloud-server then decides which gateways should respond.
LoRaWAN also allows and encourages clients to deploy their own unplanned
gateways (which we call \textit{user-deployed gateway} or \textit{UGW}) to
expand the coverage of the network.

\end{figure}

{\color{blue} (Intuitively, explain how does Charm's approach actually leads
to client power savings)} Charm allows users who are in range to transmit at
faster data rates that would not have been decodable using a single gateway
receiver. This allows for more air time for weaker transmissions from further
away clients.

% Why is it hard?
The main challenges in designing a city-scale joint-decoding system stem from
three main causes: 1. very weak receptions, 2. limited bandwidth from the
gateway to the cloud server and 3. challenges in scaling at the cloud.

\textit{Challenges at the Gateway:} Gateways receive transmissions from
distant clients which are far below the noise floor. These transmissions are
not only difficult to detect but also cannot be decoded independently.
{\color{blue} (Add actual numbers?)} Using an approach similar to
{\color{red}~\cite{} (Cloud RAN?)} would require continuously streaming all
the raw received signals to a cloud-based decoder for both detection and
decoding. Such an approach places a heavy cost on the internet bandwidth
between the gateway and the cloud, which is particularly infeasible for UGWs.% This means the devices will have to continuously stream all their received raw signal data through a backbone for packet detection and decoding the data. 
% This imposes a huge cost on the bandwidth of the backbone and also is also infeasible at low latency.
% To make matters worse, the received signals are challenging to synchronize, given the timing and frequency offsets between the base stations themselves. 

Although LoRaWAN gateways are very capable, they do not provide the raw
baseband quadrature signals which are required for joint decoding. We
developed a low-cost auxiliary platform, called RFTAP that uses a similar
radio frontend combined with a FPGA and Raspberry Pi for local signal
processing. This auxiliary hardware behaves like a software-defined radio in
the 900 MHz ISM band, generating processed quadrature streams and computing
local parameters (like spreading factor and center frequency which are
necessary inputs for the cloud-decoding algorithm).

Our solution to the bandwidth limitation problem leverages the structure of
LoRaWAN LP-WAN packets. We develop a solution that detects LoRaWAN packets
even if they are 37~dB below the noise floor and therefore remain completely
non-decodable. Our solution exploits the presence of a large number of
repeated preambles in LoRaWAN (up to 16 in the standard). Specifically, we
correlate the received sequence with long-sequences of LoRaWAN chirps to
detect the locations of packets. We repeat this process across gateways and
quickly alert neighboring base stations, should a preamble be detected. The
base station also does this for correctly decoded packets -- eliminating the
need for base stations to upload weak signals for packets already decoded.
Owing to the lenient latency constraints for acknowledgement of a packet in
LoRaWAN (one to two seconds), our approach readily scales to a large-scale
network. In effect, our approach therefore only streams to the cloud signals
that correspond to valid packets.

\textit{Scalability at the Cloud:} {\color{blue} (This section still needs
lots of work)} Another challenge Charm must deal with given its expanded
coverage, is the problem of processing a large number of streams to be
combined and decoded.

{\color{blue} Points to cover:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How to avoid wasted computations through our distributed algorithm
    (short-circuiting, selectively combining streams based on location,
    frequency and time)
    \item How is this scalable? i.e. why can we support more nodes in the
    network now? (transmit time decreases)
    \item What is the software/cloud infrastructure required to support these
    operations?
\end{itemize}
}
% Indeed, one would imagine that given that Charm serves a much larger coverage area, it scales poorly owing to collisions between users already in the network and users who newly gain coverage. 
% Counter-intuitively, we observe that in practice this is not the case. 

% We show how Charm scales despite collisions from transmissions in different geographical neighborhoods by exploiting spatial reuse -- the fact that some base stations are closer to one neighborhood and farther than the other. {\color{blue} Mention things like short-circuiting. }

%Coherent combination of packets requires inversion of individual channel effects on each of the data stream. However, across a packet the effects of the channel can be estimated by extrapolation of the channel effects at the preamble. This means we can estimate the channel at the preamble(which we can compare with a standard preamble to get the channel) and expect it to follow the same hardware offset drift pattern across the rest of the packet. Using this channel measurement we can invert the effect of channel and get all the signals in phase which we can then constructively combine to receive the packet at a much higher SNR.

{\color{blue} (Add some introduction about the nature of experiments.)} In our evaluations, we demonstrate the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We improve the range at SF 7 by XXX m, SF 10 by YYY m , and SF 12 by
    ZZZ m.
    \item With 8 base stations, we can add X m$^2$ more area to our coverage area.
    \item We can achieve gains of J dBW,K dBW and LdBW for the signal using 3,
    6 and 8 base stations, respectively.
    \item We require overheads of K MBps and provide a latency of T ms for
    detection and decoding of a packet with 8 base stations.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Contributions:} In this paper we present the following novel contributions.
\begin{itemize}
    \item A technique that leverages the geographical diversity of unplanned
    user-deployed gateways to enable joint decoding of weak transmissions.
    This improves the quality-of-service for all users and increases the
    coverage area.
    \item A hardware platform and the underlying algorithms for processing
    quadrature streams and detection of LoRa preambles in weak transmissions,
    both done locally. To reduce gateway internet bandwidth requirements, we
    also introduce a scheme that selectively forwards a subset of probable
    candidates to a cloud-based joint decoder.
    \item A software architecture that builds on top of LoRaWAN to enable
    joint-decoding of transmissions in a scaleable manner.
