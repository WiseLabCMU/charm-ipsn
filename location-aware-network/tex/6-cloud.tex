{\color{blue}
Points to cover
\begin{itemize} 
    \item Q. How to solve scaling issues in the cloud?
    \item Avoid wasted computations
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Short circuit
            \item Leverage locality of gateways (only use a subset of gateways  or decoding)
        \end{itemize}
    \item Spatial partitioning helps correctness and performance
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Leverage locality
            \item Leverage timing
        \end{itemize}
    \item Shorter transmissions help scalability
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Joint decoding protocol on the cloud}
\sec{sec:joint-decoding-cloud}


The objective of this protocol is to enable scaleable joint decoding of LoRa
transmissions given internet bandwidth limitations between the gateways and
and the cloud-based decoder.

{\color{blue} High-level algorithm description:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sent detection information
    \item Cloud server clusters potential receptions
    \item Request samples from gateways
    \item perform joint decoding
\end{itemize}
