Points to cover
\begin{itemize} 
    \item Q. How to solve scaling issues in the cloud?
    \item Avoid wasted computations
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Short circuit
            \item Leverage locality of gateways (only use a subset of gateways  or decoding)
        \end{itemize}
    \item Spatial partitioning helps correctness and performance
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Leverage locality
            \item Leverage timing
        \end{itemize}
    \item Shorter transmissions help scalability
\end{itemize}
