\subsection{Hardware}
\label{sec:hardware}

Existing LoRaWAN gateway hardware cannot provide the raw I/Q streams necessary
for joint decoding. Our custom platform, named \textit{LPRAN} and shown in
\figref{lpran-hardware} and \figref{lpran-block} {\color{blue} (ADD PHOTO and
BLOCK DIAGRAM)} is an auxiliary peripheral to a gateway and can provide the
necessary quadrature streams. It combines a Semtech SX1257 868/900 MHz RF
front-end {\color{blue} (add citation to datasheet)} with a Microsemi IGLOO
AGL250 FPGA for local processing. The processed data streams are then
transferred to a Raspberry Pi 2 over an SPI bus, which can then perform
additional local processing, time-stamping and temporary local storage until a
stream is requested by the joint-decoder.

The SX1257 RF front-end provides 1-bit delta-sigma modulated signals ($x_j$)
at 36 MSps for the I and Q streams. To convert these into analyzable samples
($s_i$), we sum consecutive samples in windows of size 64 and convert it into
a single 8-bit sample.

\begin{align*}
s_i &= \sum_{j=64*i}^{64*i + 63} x_j
\end{align*}

A window size of 64 is selected since we are only interested in a final
bandwidth of approximately 500 kHz that the RF front-end is capable of
capturing. Applying this technique, the uncompressed I/Q streams generate data
at a rate of 1.125 MBps.
